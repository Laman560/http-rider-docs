  How do you create/save or load projects in HttpRider?
---

In HttpRider, you can create and save new project workspaces. 

When you start up HttpRider for the first time, it'll automatically create a temporary project file.

To save a project, click on File -> Save or press keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + S.

To open an existing project, click on File -> Open or press keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + O.

You can also save a copy of the currently opened project by using File -> Save As and give a different project name.
